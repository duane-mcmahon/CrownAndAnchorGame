The task is to replicate, simplify, trace, and eliminate bugs using best practice debugging
techniques. The debugging effort should take place within a version control system using 
appropriately sized, commented, and timely commits.

Please note that the focus in this assignment is on the process and techniques applied, not the
complexity of the code. It is recognised that the process applied is ‘way over the top’ for 
the size of problem addressed.
